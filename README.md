# Photo Safe

With phone camera technology improving with every new release, we are taking more and more photos. The focus has always been on the social aspect of these photos, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. 

However, what if you are a gas engineer, a property manager, or like me, you tend to take photos of important content such as confidential letters? 

We require a safe place to keep these important photos, not just on our mobile phones.

The Photo Safe application allows you to sign in securely and manage all your important photos in one secure place, so you never have to worry about them falling into the wrong hands, being deleted or getting lost.

These can be identified by their labels.

- Enhancement Label: This is a feature/issue which is not essential for producing the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) but is likely to be implemented in the future.

- Bug Label: This records known bugs that require attention.

Note: Issues may contain relevant comments and snapshots.

These issues along with their corresponding milestones can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/samibirnbaum/GGA-Photo-Safe/issues) or [HuBoard](https://huboard.com/samibirnbaum/GGA-Photo-Safe#/milestones), a project manager tool I use to manage my GitHub issues.
